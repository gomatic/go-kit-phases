This branch is the general
[template folder structure](../internal/api/README.md)
for all the subsequent branches and includes the
[gRPC service and its generated Go source](../api/moody)
(initialized using the [`generate` Makefile target](../Makefile)). Ensuring the tools required to generate the gRPC
protobuf definitions is not covered but the versions are in [go.mod](../go.mod).

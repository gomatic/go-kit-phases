This is a
[CLI change](https://github.com/gomatic/go-kit-phases/compare/05-transformations...06-modified-main)
to
[main.go](../cmd/moody/main.go) to support a
[nice, declarative CLI framework](https://github.com/urfave/cli)
and support adding listeners incrementally without any merge collisions of subsequent branches.
